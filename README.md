## ‚ú® What is Chasi-Bod?

`Chasi-Bod` (pronounced similar to "chassis-body") is an open-source project inspired by the concepts of [sealer](https://github.com/sealerio/sealer) [1] and [vcluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster) [2]. It provides a powerful and simplified platform to **fuse multiple complex business systems** onto a **single, shared underlying Kubernetes cluster**, while ensuring **strong isolation** between them by leveraging virtual Kubernetes clusters (`vcluster`).

Think of `chasi-bod` as the "body" built upon the "chassis" (the underlying hardware/VMs) that provides a robust, segmented structure for different "components" (your business systems) to reside in securely and efficiently.

In today's cloud-native landscape, deploying many independent business systems often leads to infrastructure sprawl, high costs, and operational complexity. While traditional Kubernetes namespaces offer some isolation, they fall short for multi-tenant scenarios requiring stricter control-plane separation and tenancy-specific configurations.

`Chasi-bod` addresses these challenges by:

* **Building** a unified, image-based platform artifact that bundles the OS, Kubernetes, container runtime, and core platform components.
* **Sharing** this platform artifact for consistent and repeatable deployments.
* **Running** the platform as a Host Kubernetes cluster.
* **Managing** the lifecycle of isolated virtual Kubernetes clusters (`vclusters`) within the Host cluster for each business system or group.
* **Simplifying** the deployment, configuration, and operations of both the platform and the business systems running on it.

## üöÄ Features & Goals

* **Image-Based Platform Management:** Package the entire infrastructure stack (OS, K8s, Runtime, `vcluster` components) into a versioned image for simplified deployment and upgrade.
* **Multi-Tenancy with vCluster Isolation:** Provide each business system with its own isolated virtual Kubernetes cluster, enhancing security and flexibility compared to namespaces.
* **Simplified Business System Onboarding:** Define clear standards and templates for deploying applications into their respective `vclusters`.
* **Unified Configuration Management:** Centralize and streamline complex configurations for networking, storage, system parameters (`sysctl`), and resource partitioning.
* **Optimized for Mixed Workloads:** Consider and provide guidance/configurations for different application types (CPU, I/O, Memory intensive) running side-by-side.
* **Full Lifecycle Management:** Support building, distributing, deploying, upgrading, scaling, and operating the entire stack.
* **Built-in DFX Capabilities:** Incorporate design for excellence, including observability, reliability, and testability.

## üí° Core Concepts

* **Chasi-Bod Platform Image:** The portable artifact (ISO, OVA, QCOW2, etc.) containing everything needed to boot up the Host Cluster. Inspired by sealer's ClusterImage.
* **Host Cluster:** The foundational Kubernetes cluster running directly on the infrastructure nodes, managed by Chasi-Bod. It hosts the `vcluster` pods.
* **vCluster (Virtual Cluster):** A lightweight Kubernetes cluster running *inside* a namespace on the Host Cluster. Each business system interacts with its own vCluster API.
* **Business System Application:** The actual application workload deployed within a specific vCluster.
* **Chasi-Bod Management Plane:** The core logic of the Chasi-Bod project responsible for building images, deploying/managing the Host Cluster, provisioning `vclusters`, and orchestrating application deployments.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

`Chasi-Bod` employs a layered architecture, covering everything from the bootloader up to the application deployment layer.

At a high level, it consists of:

1.  **Infrastructure Layer:** Physical/Virtual Machines, OS, Filesystem, Network, Storage.
2.  **Host Kubernetes Layer:** The shared Kubernetes cluster running on the infrastructure.
3.  **Virtual Cluster / Application Layer:** Isolated `vcluster` instances and the business applications running within them.
4.  **Chasi-Bod Management Plane:** The control logic orchestrating build, deploy, and manage operations across all layers.

For a detailed breakdown, please refer to the [architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## üß† How It Works

1.  **Build:** Define your platform requirements (OS, K8s version, CNI/CSI plugins, base tools) using Chasi-Bod's configuration. Chasi-Bod builds a reproducible Platform Image.
2.  **Share:** Distribute the Platform Image (e.g., upload to a repository).
3.  **Run (Deploy):** Use the Chasi-Bod CLI or API to deploy the Platform Image onto bare metal or VMs. This automatically sets up the Host OS and the Host Kubernetes Cluster.
4.  **Manage:** Use Chasi-Bod to provision isolated `vclusters` for each business system based on predefined templates.
5.  **Deploy Applications:** Use Chasi-Bod to deploy business system applications (e.g., Helm Charts) into their designated `vclusters`. Chasi-Bod ensures proper configuration injection and lifecycle management within the virtualized environment.
